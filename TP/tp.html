	                               Founders Edition Announcing the GeForce 10-series products, Nvidia has introduced Founders Edition graphics card versions of the GTX 1060, 1070, 1070 Ti, 1080 and 1080 Ti. These are what were previously known as reference cards, i.e. which were designed and built by Nvidia and not by its authorized board partners. These cards have started being used as reference to measure performance of partner cards. The Founders Edition cards have a die cast machine-finished aluminum body with a single radial fan and a vapor chamber cooling (1070 Ti, 1080, 1080 Ti only[13]), an upgraded power supply and a new low profile backplate (1070, 1070 Ti, 1080, 1080 Ti only). [14] Nvidia also released a limited supply of Founders Edition cards for the GTX 1060 that were only available directly from Nvidia's website.[15] Founders Edition cards prices (with the exception of the GTX 1070 Ti and 1080 Ti) are greater than MSRP of partners cards; however, some partners' cards, incorporating a complex design, with liquid or hybrid cooling may cost more than Founders Edition. The biggest highlight to this line of notebook GPUs is the implementation of configured specifications close to (for the GTX 1060â€“1080) and exceeding (for the GTX 1050/1050 Ti) that of their desktop counterparts, as opposed to having "cut-down" specifications in previous generations. As a result, the "M" suffix is completely removed from the model's naming schemes, denoting these notebook GPUs to possess similar performance to those made for desktop PCs, including the ability to overclock their core frequencies by the user, something not possible with previous generations of notebook GPUs. This was made possible by having lower Thermal Design Power (TDP) ratings as compared to their desktop equivalents, making these desktop-level GPUs thermally feasible to be implemented into OEM notebook chassis with improved thermal dissipation designs, and, as such, are only available through the OEMs. In addition, the GP104 and GP106-based Notebook GPUs also come in lower-TDP and quieter variations called the Max-Q Design specifically made for ultra-thin gaming systems in conjunction with OEM Partners that incorporate enhanced heat dissipation mechanisms with lower operating noise volumes, largely made as an additional more powerful option to existing gaming notebooks as well, which was launched on 27th June 2017.The Pascal (microarchitecture), named after Blaise Pascal, was announced in March 2014.[1], and the first graphics cards based on it, the GeForce GTX 1080 and 1070, were announced on May 6th, 2016 and released on May 27th, 2016 and June 10th respectively. It[clarification needed] incorporates TSMC's 16 nm FinFET technology and succeeds the Maxwell microarchitecture.[2] Samsung Electronics and Nvidia also have an agreement to shrink the design's die to use Samsung's 14 nm FinFET technology.[3] New Features in GP10x: CUDA Compute Capability 6.0 (GP100 only), 6.1 (GP102, GP104, GP106, GP107, GP108) DisplayPort 1.4 HDMI 2.0b Fourth generation Delta Color Compression PureVideo Feature Set H hardware video decoding HEVC Main10 (10 bit), Main12 (12 bit) & VP9 hardware decoding (GM200 & GM204 did not support HEVC Main10/Main12 & VP9 hardware decoding)[4] HDCP 2.2 support for 4K DRM protected content playback & streaming
